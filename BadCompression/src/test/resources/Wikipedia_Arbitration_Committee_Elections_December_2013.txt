== For the enjoyment of complaining ==

I have no idea what's going on here. Luckily I don't care about the arbitration committee, so it doesn't matter ''that'' much -- but I'm a pretty smart guy and don't think I could make heads or tails of this page without intense study, which could say something about what other uninitiateds are seeing. Of course, there's also the possibility that I'm simply not as smart as I thought I was, in which case you may want to disregard this. Contributors may nevertheless want to take the approach that stuff like this should be written with dumb people in mind. Pretend your audience has not one iota of a flippin' clue what a "tranche" is, for instance. Also the timeline graphic is made more confusing by its 8-bit [[kerning]] (what the hell is a ''cardidate''?). <font style="color:#0059B2;text-shadow:0px 0px 5px #80BFFF">[[User:Equazcion|<font color="#0059B2">equazcion</font>]] [[User talk:Equazcion|<font color=#0059B2>→</font>]] <span style="font-size:88%">08:46, 10 Nov 2013 (UTC)</span></font>
:I think "tranche" is a word that someone decided, long ago (before my time), should be the word that Wikipedia uses instead of the more common "class" or "group" to refer to the, er, classes of arbitrators whose terms expire in different years.  Personally I think the vast majority of readers can figure out what it means from the context.  As far as I know, nobody has ever bothered to try to change it, though when I am writing about the subject in the annual election RfC's, I usually say "tranches or classes" because the word "tranche" does seem awkward to me.  (Someone else in the RfC this year pointed out that, outside Wikipedia, the term ''only'' seems to be used in the context of a certain type of financing transaction, and I have never seen it used outside the financing context either.)  But as I said, it is one of those things people seem to just live with.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 00:50, 12 November 2013 (UTC)
:: It should be changed. I have three college degrees and I still had to look up "tranche" in the dictionary. I'm guessing it comes out of Wales' work in finance. And also, in previous iterations, there were different tranches for different lengths of time (one year, two year, three year) and each tranche had a different name. As it is now, it should simply say that 8 Arbitrators are elected each year for terms of two years and if there are vacancies from the previous year's class/cohort, there will be X openings for a one year term. 
:: Maybe the Election Committee could make this change? I think it is confusing language for people who've never participated in an Arbitration Committee Election before. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 19:06, 12 November 2013 (UTC)
:::Personally I don't think this is a big issue, but I am adding the parenthetical term "(groups)" after "tranches", so if anybody ''really'' can't tell what "tranches" means from the context (or from the new link to Wiktionary), it might be clearer to them.  I would not remove the word "tranche" because, whether we like it or not, that is the word that Wikipedia editors have been seeing in this context for years - perhaps as long as the committee has existed.  This way everybody will be happy.  (Just kidding, I know nobody is ever happy.)  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 22:29, 13 November 2013 (UTC)

== Voter guide on banned user's talk page? ==

Since {{u|Kiefer.Wolfowitz}} is currently under an indefinite ban (see [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Kiefer.Wolfowitz and Ironholds#Kiefer.Wolfowitz banned]]), I seriously question whether he should be maintaining an ACE2013 voter guide on his talk page (see [[User talk:Kiefer.Wolfowitz#Voting guide: Arbitration Election 2013]]).  What do others think?  —&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich</u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''</small> 21:32, 11 November 2013 (UTC)
:If it were a static complaint I'd leave it alone, but a banned user using userspace to actively maintain a project should probably be gone.

:: (ec) He wrote a good guide in 2012 (and was polite enough [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kiefer.Wolfowitz&oldid=529629675#Afterwards to say that mine was better]). Does being banned change his ability to observe?

:::The [[WP:BAN|Banning Policy]] says that a site-banned editor ''"is forbidden from making any edit, anywhere on Wikipedia"'', with the single exception that editors may appeal their ban via their talk page.  This particular editor was '''indefinitely''' banned, by the Arbitration Committee, and must wait until at least next August before he is allowed to ask ArbCom to end his ban.  The prohibition on site-banned editors using their own talk pages is frequently not enforced in practice — but in this case the user is (IMO) actively attempting to engage the community, not only by putting together recommendations for voting in the upcoming election, but also by tagging his "voter guide" with a category tag that may presumably cause his material to be included in the list of voter guides.

:::Since I am standing in this election, and Kiefer's comments are highly critical of my candidacy, I realize some people may see a conflict of interest in my bringing up the issue.  That's why I chose to discuss it here and see what other people think, rather than taking it straight to [[WP:ANI]] or some other enforcement forum.  I also realize that since the prohibition on site-banned editors soapboxing on their talk pages is not consistently enforced, the consensus might be that it's OK for Kiefer to say whatever he wants on his talk page, but '''''not OK''''' for him to try to get his "voter guide" listed amongst the officially recognized guides.  If people think Kiefer has crossed the line and ought to have his talk page access blocked, I think it might be better if someone else (other than I) were to bring the issue to ANI.  —&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich</u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''</small> 22:47, 11 November 2013 (UTC)

I am posting a link to this discussion (and the one that Equazcion started at ANI) at [[Wikipedia talk:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2013/Coordination]], which seems to be the right place to get the attention of the people running the election.  At least, that is where you go when you click on "Contact the coordinators" on the election template.  It seems that nobody has actually signed up to be a "coordinator" yet, but we do have three appointed Election Commissioners, and I would say this is an issue for them.  (And I would also say the real issue is not that the user in question is posting about the election on his talk page, but that his talk page is listed in the Voter Guide section of the "official" election template.)

== Better chart? ==
Since I complained about the timeline's readability, I thought I might do something about it. The timeline coding is pretty limited, and normal-sized text just comes out all stupid looking, but I managed to mangle it into something that I think is more readable: [[Template:ArbitrationCommitteeChartRecent/sandbox]]. If anyone thinks that version is better they can feel free to replace the current one, or let me know and I'll do it. <font style="color:#0059B2;text-shadow:0px 0px 5px #80BFFF">[[User:Equazcion|<font color="#0059B2">equazcion</font>]] [[User talk:Equazcion|<font color=#0059B2>→</font>]] <span style="font-size:88%">23:38, 11 Nov 2013 (UTC)</span></font>
:Thank you.  I thought about doing that when I saw your post above, and actually went into edit mode on the template - and immediately realized it was nothing that I should be touching with a ten-foot pole.  I figured that a technical-type person like you would come along and fix what I would probably only break more.  It is definitely more readable without the distracting spacing issues (and doesn't smash letters together, so no more "Cardidate".)  The only thing I would point out is that the phrase in the introduction, "on one screen without scrolling", may no longer be accurate depending on one's browser settings.  I had to shrink everything down two levels, but I guess I usually have my browser set on can't-see-very-well-even-with-glasses.  And actually at that size it is now ''much'' more readable than it was before, so I would say, please post it.  Since it is still possible to see it on one screen (even though someone might have to change browser settings), I guess the description can remain as is.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 00:41, 12 November 2013 (UTC)
:I view Wikipedia at 125 per cent magnification (running Vector skin on Chrome) and the sandbox version has about a quarter of the chart out of sight to the right. If I scroll over to the point where the tool bar on the left disappears, it fits on the screen very nicely. It looks good in mobile view. [[:Template:ArbitrationCommitteeChart]] shows the whole works on one screen, but is too tiny and blurry for me to to read. [[:Template:ArbitrationCommitteeChartRecent]] is also quite blurry on my set-up. My preference would be the sandbox version -- [[User:Diannaa|Diannaa]] ([[User talk:Diannaa|talk]]) 00:44, 12 November 2013 (UTC)
::No problem :) I tried to keep the size down, but it seems the timeline coding is so limited that there's not much to be done about it -- it's either small enough to cause the text issues or large enough to bleed into scrolling territory for some users. I think the latter is the lesser of the two evils though. I will post it but I'll remove the message, since most users are likely to leave it at the default browser size and scroll to view it, if their screen resolution calls for it. Thanks for the feedback :) <font style="color:#0059B2;text-shadow:0px 0px 5px #80BFFF">[[User:Equazcion|<font color="#0059B2">equazcion</font>]] [[User talk:Equazcion|<font color=#0059B2>→</font>]] <span style="font-size:88%">00:50, 12 Nov 2013 (UTC)</span></font>
:As far as I'm aware, the "Recent" chart is only supposed to show enough years to include the beginning of each currently sitting arbitrator's term; so we can actually knock two years off the start, which would make it more compact.

:::Q. Why does the chart state "Dec 2013 top 8 Candidates" and "Dec 2013 9th place"? 
::::I could probably explain this better if I understood it fully myself, but according to my reading of [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2013#Vacant seats|the vacant seats section]], the top 8 candidates get 2-year terms, while the 9th place candidate gets a 1-year term. <font style="color:#0059B2;text-shadow:0px 0px 5px #80BFFF">[[User:Equazcion|<font color="#0059B2">equazcion</font>]] [[User talk:Equazcion|<font color=#0059B2>→</font>]] <span style="font-size:88%">14:20, 13 Nov 2013 (UTC)</span></font>
::::In other words, 9 candidates will be elected. The one of those who comes in last (the one with the least votes out of those nine?) only gets a one-year term.

:::::The 8 in the bottom section were elected in Dec 2011 and have sat for 2 years so they are out of a job (unless re-elected) when the new AC takes over.

== Lowest turnout for candidates ever? ==
Perhaps I haven't paid as much attention to arbcom elections as others, but unless I'm mistaken, so far we have the lowest turnout for candidacies for arbcom since it was founded. I can think of a dozen excellent candidates but I doubt they would be interested.--[[User:MONGO|MONGO]]15:50, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
:We are behind 1 from this point last year, so it is too soon to say. Often, candidates wait until the later half of the nominating period before announcing.

:: I was just going to pose this question, for those who are familiar with previous elections, [[User:Monty845|<font color="Green">Monty</font>]], if this was an unusually low number of candidates. Are there typically a lot of Editors filing statements on the last day? Also, it seems like in previous elections, the nomination period was longer (two weeks?) but I can't recall when that changed. Having such a short nominating period means that you'll mainly get candidates who've been thinking about running for a long time along with candidates who are acting more impulsively (nothing wrong with that if they are a strong candidate!). There is less time to go lobby Editors who you'd think would be good candidates, to persuade them to run.
:: Also, [[User:MONGO|MONGO]], I know of at least two (could be three) candidates who have already withdrawn. I think the level of experience and tenure on Wikipedia from the candidates who are still running in the election is pretty high. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 21:11, 13 November 2013 (UTC)
:::I don't have any hard figures, but as a rule of thumb, candidacies are announced disproportionately very early or very late, with few in the middle period.  Hence, I suppose, the belief that the length of the nomination period is not overly important, since a longer period just produces a larger 'middle' section...

It's part of the "collective memory" that is probably buried in talk page comments. This turnout led me to wonder if there might not even be nine candidates running!

:::::Without delving into past history and past dramas, I doubt that Jimbo would appoint people to the committee who were not elected.  I remember reading something about the idea that, if the Arbitration Committee believed that it had been left with an insufficient number of members, Jimbo would consider calling a special election.  More generally, I suspect that '''if''' it turns out that there are fewer than nine candidates, there will be a great deal of discussion about a large number of possibilities, ranging from... well, let's not even go there unless and until we have to.  Let's just say that if it does happen, the resulting controversy will be the Next Big Thing on Wikipedia.  But there is still a week to go before the deadline for nominations.  I am hoping there will be at least 18 candidates.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 00:20, 14 November 2013 (UTC)
::::::Note also that last year 13/21 candidates passed the 50% cutoff. While it is certainly better to have an abundance of acceptable candidates, that we can seat those with the highest supports, based on last year's numbers, we would need only 15 candidates to fill the 9 seats. If it looks like it may be close, perhaps voters could be encouraged to oppose sparingly, but I agree we should see what the field looks like at the close of nominations before worrying too much.

:::::::If there are 9 or fewer candidates then there is no reason for those who oppose for tactical reasons to do so and very little with only 10. My gut feeling is that those who vocally vote tactically are a greater proportion of all vocal voters than those who silently vote tactically are of all silent voters, but I obviously have no way of knowing whether that is true.

:::::::::::Indeed, there is nothing wrong with tactical voting. My point simply was that if there is no tactical voting then in theory there should be fewer oppose votes. The reason being that there are two reasons to oppose - (1) because you think the candidate would not be suitable for arbcom, and (2) because you think a different candidate would be better suited. If every candidate with >=50% support is guaranteed a seat then there is no reason to oppose for reason 2. Indeed, if people only support their favourite N candidates there is a greater chance of any individual candidate being in that N.

== Should ACE2013 guides make "ratings" of other guides with personal comments or charges about the ''authors'' thereof? == 

Is it proper to "rate" ''other guides'' on the basis of personal comments about the person who has not yet even ''written'' any ratings of any candidates?  I am affronted by one user whose guide says to ignore my ''unwritten ratings'' on the basis that I was added to a case ''after'' the workshop and evidence phases were completed -- thus (apparently?) making any ratings I offer to be anathema.  I suggest that each guide should stick to ''issues about candidates'', and not make personal comments about other editors who are ''not'' candidates.  Cheers.

::::Yet you referred ''specifically'' to a recent case as being the problem -- and that my views are "extreme" -- I ask you to note that this ''is'' still a problem from my point of view, as I find the possibility that a clerk would have such prejudice about any editor to be exceedingly distasteful, just as I would find any ArbCom candidate showing such prejudice about any editor to be, frankly, ''unqualified for any position of trust''.   And you did ''not'' remove the claim that ''some ACE2013 essays are "extreme"'' and so your "redaction" is actually pretty much ''wertlos''. Cheers.

== Statement from the WMF ==

The WMF wishes to make the following statement, in response to questions raised on my talk page.  

-----
The Wikimedia Foundation has been asked to clarify and/or expand on a previous decision of the legal team, specifically that the Foundation would not allow users to have Checkuser or Oversight rights added to the user account of a user who had not passed a request for adminship or an equally rigorous community selection process.
 
Our legal and community advocacy team has been asked whether running for (and winning) a seat on the Arbitration Committee would meet the "rigorous community selection process" test, and therefore qualify an elected ArbCom member for Checkuser/Oversight rights. We believe that being elected to ArbCom is an involved process that strongly demonstrates community trust, and that there is a reasonable expectation that Arbitration Committee members on the English Wikipedia's Arbcom will hold those tools, except in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, we will not object to the assignment of checkuser/oversight tools to any user who runs for, wins, and is seated on the Arbitration Committee.<br />
Respectfully,<br />
Philippe Beaudette<br />
Director, Community Advocacy

I am, of course, open to clarification, though I'm traveling tomorrow, so it may be a couple of days.  [[User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe Beaudette, Wikimedia Foundation]] ([[User talk:Philippe (WMF)|talk]]) 23:56, 18 November 2013 (UTC)

Yeah, I'm glad to read this, to hear that non-Admins can run for ARBCOM, too.

:It does represent a lower standard. You only need 50% approval to get elected to ArbCom. Such an RfA would not succeed. [[User:Hawkeye7|Hawkeye7]] ([[User talk:Hawkeye7|talk]]) 18:47, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
::I do agree that its a lower standard in the sense that it only requires a 50% approval. I also think however that due to the position the majority of the voters are going to be very seasoned and experienced and would likely not elect someone to Arbcom without having some experience being an admin first. This is even more dubious if the editor has multiple RFA failures. I for one am glad and agree with the WMF statement/decision but I don't think the community will accept it. I hope I am wrong though because IMO it will be of benefit to have both admins and nonadmins on the committee. A good followup question is will said individual be allowed to keep said rights once they are done being a member of the committee or have them revoked.

::The pass rates in the two different kinds of election are not directly comparable, and a 50% pass rate in ArbCom is not necessarily lower standard than the RfA pass rate - a single-candidate support/oppose is completely different from a multi-candidate election with a limited number of seats. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2013#Statement_by_Boing.21_said_Zebedee here] for further explanation. -- [[User:Boing! said Zebedee|Boing! said Zebedee]] ([[User talk:Boing! said Zebedee|talk]]) 19:18, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:::I do not think it is a "lower standard" in light of the fact that in an ArbCom election there are opponents and a limited number of seats.  At most, nine of the 25 (or so) candidates in this election will be elected, regardless of what percentages they get.  It is good to see that this has been clarified in favor of allowing non-admins to run.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 20:23, 20 November 2013 (UTC)
:: This sounds like you are not just talking about voting margins but also believe that Admins are of a higher standard than regular Editors who haven't been through an RfA. I disagree. There are capable, experienced, knowledgeable, even-tempered Editors who do not have the desire to become an Admin. I'd also argue that the skills that would make a user a good Arbitrator are different from the skills that make one a good Admin. An arbitrator needs to know policy, precedent and sifts through a mountain of evidence and diffs. This is quite different from fighting vandalism, deleting pages and active AN/I debates although both require an understanding of WP policy and guidelines. Admins work swiftly, Arbitrators need to be more deliberate. I think a background in mediation would be more valuable quality for future Arbitrators than having a record number of blocks imposed or articles deleted. One doesn't need to be an Admin to have this experience. <font face="Rage Italic" size="4" color="#800080">[[User:Liz|'''''L'''''iz]]</font> <sup><font face="Times New Roman" color="#006400">[[Special:Contributions/Liz|'''''Read!''''']] [[User talk:Liz|'''''Talk!''''']]</font></sup> 13:09, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

The reason we have a withdrawn candidate is because before the names are inputted, an XML file gets imported into SecurePoll that basically sets up placeholders.  23 placeholders were set up, but with Secret's withdrawl, that leaves 22 candidates.  We cannot remove that 23rd placeholder, and so all we can do is mark it as withdrawn.--v/r - [[User:TParis|T]][[User_talk:TParis|P]] 01:51, 25 November 2013 (UTC)
:This is extremely confusing. I read all the names below "withdrawn before voting began" as being withdrawn. And I'm sure no small number of other people do as well. Which means we don't pick anything for those below. That needs to be clarified as indicating its own line and not everything below it.

:::Why would I bother to vote anything on those names if I think all the names beneath "Withdrawn before voting began" have been withdrawn?

== Logging in from different domains? ==

I note at [[Special:SecurePoll/list/331]] that there are users who seem to be voting from multiple other domains. It is my understanding that SecurePoll is supposed to be logging the domain from which the vote originated, not the "home wiki" of the voter.  How is this happening?  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 05:07, 25 November 2013 (UTC)
:At a guess (and it is only a guess), it's the wiki on which the user most recently logged in (ie where their SUL login session is propagating from).  I don't think it's an issue as long as they are not able to vote multiple times (as happened a few years ago, I think 2009).  Are you aware of anyone who has voted multiple times from different domains? [[User:Happy-melon|<b style="color:forestgreen">Happy</b>]]‑[[User talk:Happy-melon|<b style="color:darkorange">melon</b>]] 10:21, 25 November 2013 (UTC)
::Did some more researching on this; it turns out that it is indeed listing the home wiki of the user, rather than the wiki on which the vote was made. While this shouldn't be too problematic for this one specific election (although I suggest that the election commission create a list of the non-enwiki votes so that users can verify eligibility on this project, just as a precaution), it does mess up the data.  The effect would be very concerning on a multi-wiki election, as it would inaccurately reflect voting patterns and would make tracking down problem votes much more difficult, and I've suggested that a bugzilla be filed to fix this in SecurePoll. It's not clear to me what's happened since May (when voter lists were run for the WMF Board/FDC elections) that would have resulted in SecurePoll using "home wiki" instead of "project where vote occurred" for the applicable domain, but it is one more reason that SecurePoll has to be rewritten and its documentation improved.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 13:59, 25 November 2013 (UTC)
:::Yeah, a bug to look into this would be good. I'm not sure what happened since it's clear that this was not an issue for past arbcom/functionary elections but it's possible that the bug existed before the board election (the only cause I can think of right now is changes to centralauth/loginwiki but I don't know why it would be ). The board election passed voter wiki somewhat manually since it went to an central vote wiki and so it's possible it skipped around this bug and we didn't notice it.

== There is no incentive to read the questions to candidates prior to voting ==

One may choose to read them or not, but there is no incentive to do so. My strong suspicion is that they are ignored and the entire ballot is based upon a mixture of prior popularity (The "swimsuit round") and candidate's statement (The "I want to work with old people and children round").

While there is no opportunity to alter the process for this election, serious consideration should be given to this for subsequent elections.

The contra issue to this is that the nomination and voting process is already unwieldy. [[User:Timtrent|<span style="color:#800">Fiddle</span>]] [[User talk:Timtrent|<span style="color:#070">Faddle</span>]] 10:55, 26 November 2013 (UTC)

::It is hard indeed to see how one might improve matters since people always have the option not to do the correct thing.

::I do not dispute that we have the absolute right to vote as if it were a beauty contest (Uk general elections, US presidential elections etc), but I hope to encourage people to see the entire picture.

:::Sounds to me as if you're seeking a way to ''force'' the electorate to view a select aspect of "the picture"—or view it from a select angle. The questions and answers exist and links to them are made readily available throughout the election pages and on the voting form itself. The incentive to use these links would be an electors own desire to be informed. Getting overly concerned about the quality of the electorate and trying to actively compensate for it seems to be a slippery slope to me.

I know this is probably a technical issue with Special:SecurePoll and it's extension, and if no-one beats me to it I'll submit a bug report on Bugzilla for it later.  Just wanted to jot it down (in case it is just another minor configuration error that you can easily fix) someplace so others can know it's been seen and will be reported (and maybe fixed before this poll is complete).

::Well, I've been advocating strongly for a rewrite and proper documentation of SecurePoll ever since I had to work with it as an election admin for the WMF Board/FDC elections earlier this year. The software is extremely finicky, hasn't been updated in years, isn't keeping pace with the improvements in the rest of MediaWiki (and when it does, it does so in perverse ways, such as indicating "domain" as the user's home wiki rather than the domain from which they voted), and it's incredibly easy to make errors.  It seems that the issue you're identifying will not affect the outcome of the election; it's not interfering with anyone's ability to vote.  Therefore, I'd suggest it be filed as a bugzilla for future work, although I have been given to understand that Engineering does not consider this a priority.  If you do file a bugzilla, could you please either include me in the CC or leave me a link on my talk page?  Thanks!  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 14:28, 26 November 2013 (UTC)
::: Does ''domain'' really refer to the user's home wiki? Good grief, that's confusing. When looking at the log, I always thought a lot of people just liked to vote from other sites. The foundation loves reducing costs, so let's frame the proposal in terms they'll like. Writing a better voting extension would offer the foundation a chance to open the administration of elections to non-staff users, through an on-wiki interface (Stewards could set up global elections on Meta; bureaucrats could set up ArbCom elections on here; etc.). For a short-term investment of developer time, they'd therefore never have the headache of manually setting up elections every year, and we'd have a fit-for-purpose elections interface.

::::That's what "domain" is referring to this time; five months ago during the Board elections, it referred to the location where the person voted, and nobody is certain exactly why or how this changed. WMF sysadmins will always have to be involved in preparation of whatever software is involved because the voter lists pull from non-public data to some extent, and because the polls need to be encrypted, but I suspect that a complete rewrite with very good step-by-step documentation done by volunteer developers with sufficient access might get things done.  It's not about costs, apparently, it's about staff time and priorities; in fairness, SecurePoll is used so rarely that absent a direction from the Board to get this done (it was originally designed for secure WMF Board elections), it's not going to be at the top of anyone's list.

:::This is part of life in Wikipedia unfortunately. For a user to become an admin they have to run through a gauntlet, have every piece of dirty laundry drug out and scattered around, present a virgin and sacrifice a goat...just to be able to see deleted content and delete vandalism. Then the Arbcom, who are supposed to be a group of our most trusted users and are elected to participate in some of the most sensitive areas of the project hold "secret" ballots, with minimal comment and then they are there for a year? Then they make it so complicated only the most experienced editors will even turn out or those who have a vested interest. I doubt there will be more than 200 editors and that's a generous number. Last year I don't think it was that many. Then there are problems with the vote and it had to be wiped out and advertised to restart, which frankly probably helped draw in people because its a big banner message at the top. Then they come here and have to navigate a maze? It hardly makes sense but its just par for the course here. Personally I wouldn't vote for any incumbent or clerk. There was one or 2 highly qualified persons, several more somewhat less qualified a non admin (which I think is good) and there is someone who works for the WMF (which I also think is quite good).

See [[Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2012#Clarification_of_mainspace|here]]. So you still had scrutineers having to check eligibility last year as well. But this year the config file didn't even have that 150-edit limit in it or a setting to leave out blocked editors (that seems to have been a major oversight)? More generally, was the potential problem carrying over from last year even discussed by the community at the pre-election RFC or the post-2012 election feedback page? Has SecurePoll changed since last year so it could have been set to count mainspace edits (I doubt it)? The focus now, if nothing more can be done, needs to be on people pitching in to help check eligibility, and making sure those not eligible are ''politely'' told why they were allowed to vote and what is being done about this. Last year I said ''"I also agree that the voting system really should be set up properly next time, so there is less of the rather embarrassing spectacle of good-faith voters having their votes struck because the software didn't tell them they were ineligible (I know why it happened this time, but it should really be avoided)."''

== How are sockpuppets dealt with? ==

Checking to see how many mainspace edits a voter has is relatively easy, and something anyone can do, but how is the problem of sockpuppetry dealt with?  Is there a CU available to rule out potential sockpuppetry?<p>I raise the issue because in looking over the voting log I see teo users, Mrmoustache14 and MrMoustacheMM, who disavow any connection to each other on their respective talk pages, but who voted within 18 minutes of each other.  I am explicitly '''''not''''' accusing these editors of being sockpuppets, and the similarity of their names can be explained by their being based on the name of a song, but such a ''prima facie'' example of the '''''possibility''''' of sockpuppetry raises the question of how that is dealt with.

=="An Abstain does not affect the outcome in any way"==
What a nonsensical statement, of course it affects the outcome if I choose Abstain rather than Support, or Abstain rather than Oppose. [[User:W. P. Uzer|W. P. Uzer]] ([[User talk:W. P. Uzer|talk]]) 10:31, 28 November 2013 (UTC)
:But voting abstain for all candidates would have the same effect as not voting (ie nothing), which is what the statement means.  In most elections voters have the option to only vote in part of the election by leaving other parts blank; this is a reassurance that it is still possible to do so, despite being forced to mark one checkbox for each candidate in order to be able to submit a ballot at all.

:::There are no parts where you have the option to vote separately; that's the point.  In an election you can generally "not affect the outcome" by not writing an X or a number or whatever on the given section of the ballot.

::::You're not making any sense. You can "not affect the outcome" by not voting at all, or by submitting a ballot paper with Abstains (plural) for all the candidates. It is not true in any sense that I can divine, that a single "Abstain" does "not affect the outcome". My choice to Abstain for a particular candidate, as opposed to exercising any other of my available options (which are only Support and Oppose, from what I can tell), certainly may affect the outcome.

This is all part of the alleged wisdom of crowds. We have the bureaucracy we have created, thus it must be the one we deserve!

:(Innocent bystander interjection) My understanding is that candidates are ranked according to S/(S+O), i.e. abstain votes are ignored in calculating the ratio for each candidate. Therefore the intended interpretation of the statement is as follows: if I vote S for a candidate, I nudge their ratio higher and therefore actively increase their likelihood of being elected. If I vote O, I nudge their ratio lower and decrease their likelihood. If I vote A, I do not affect their ratio, and my direct impact *on them* is the same as if I had not voted at all. The statement is intended to negate the plausible but incorrect alternate assumption that I would be reducing a candidate's support percentage merely by casting any ballot in which I failed to explicitly support them. It is of course true that by voting S or O for other candidates and thereby affecting their ratios, I am expressing a rank order of candidates, and so indirectly the candidates I vote A on will be impacted in relation to the others. However it is at least theoretically possible that a candidate with a handful of S, no O, and nearly all As would rank higher than a candidate with no A, one O, and everyone else an S.

:::::I think I broadly agree with [[User:W._P._Uzer]] regarding the desirability of some kind of link. If I mainly want to elect one candidate, the most effective way I can cast my vote to do this is to Support that candidate and Oppose all other candidates. Telling me that Abstain makes no difference may mislead me into being 'nice' by abstaining instead of opposing. Something similar is true if I mainly want to stop one candidate, or if I want to elect 7 candidates, etc. But if I want to elect one candidate and also stop another it might well be best to abstain on some of the remaining candidates - basically, especially if I have found a reasonably trustworthy 'guide to guides' (which is a kind of opinion poll), I'd want to oppose those who seem a threat to my favourite candidate, support those who seem a threat to my most hated candidate, and perhaps abstain where the precise threat position seems unclear. Perhaps what's needed is a link to something that explains (as far as reasonably practicable) 'How your vote works in practice', while also making it clear that the precise effect of abstentions can't always be reliably predicted (while perhaps adding that 'guides to guides', which are a kind of opinion poll, if reasonably trustworthy, can at least in theory help with such tactical voting decisions, and while perhaps also adding that it may not be easy to work out how honest and trustworthy any such 'guide to guides' actually is).

== Banned users voting via sockpuppets ==

{{user|Phil Sandifer}} appears to have voted in these elections as {{user|Mr. Treason}}, whom I recently blocked. The account was originally blocked by {{user|Zoe}} on 1 April 2006, since it was taken to be a sock of a vandal. Phil Sandifer (then {{user|Snowspinner}}), promptly unblocked the account with the summary "/scowl". It was promptly re-blocked by another admin. Presumably, the wheel-warring was due to April Fool's Day clowning around, a view bolstered by this account [[Special:Contributions/Mr. Treason|being used]] to comment on 1 April on ANI regarding joke RFAs. A long-term abuse page was created in the name of this account for a group of trolling IPs who liked to claim "treason". A perusal of the history shows that Phil Sandifer and Mr. Treason both edited the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/Mr._Treason&offset=&limit=500&action=history]. Finally, the account [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse/Mr._Treason&diff=4503320 claimed] to be Snowspinner, and Phil Sandifer (then Snowspinner), did not block the account for impersonation.

== questions are out of control ==

I just counted, and as of right now I have answered ''sixty three'' questions, almost every last one of them a boilerplate that was submitted to every single candidate, and some of them basically retreads of questions that were already asked and answered. I realize that arbs have to put up with a lot more than that, but do we expect the voting public to actually review that many replies? Some have had even more, but if we say the average is sixty that means there are something like thirteen hundred questions and answers in total.

*Perhaps posting identical 'boilerplate' questions to all the candidates allows electors to observe how candidates respond differently to a common stimulus and thus make comparative inferences about style and character. I suspect in part it's also a way for electors to feel 'involved'. Also, some may simply be following the example that was set by having 'official' boilerplate questions preceding the space for individual questions. Perhaps it would be helpful if boilerplate and candidate specific questions were on separate subpages? Or perhaps some sort of pre-election process of community proposing and narrowing down boilerplate question? Merging similar ones and such? Also, it strikes me that if truly redundant questions arise the candidate has the option to simply reply by linking a previous answer perhaps with qualifiers if differences in nuance need addressed. 

:Obviously it would be easiest for the candidates if a bare list of Usernames was simply tossed up and the electors were left to do all their own research and to initiate independent inquiries on talk pages discussions if they have questions.

I think the questions need to be brought under some control for next year.  Maybe individual editors need to be limited to one or two questions.  (I can hear the yelling and table-pounding already.)  Or maybe the "fallow period" between the end of nominations and the beginning of voting needs to be greatly expanded - like to 3 or 4 weeks - to give candidates enough of a chance to really think about the questions and answer them.  I have also noticed a bit of foot-stomping about candidates not answering questions, when those who decided to run at the last minute really only had a couple of days to answer them.  That would also be remedied by allowing more time before voting starts.  In "real" elections (at least in my state) there are four months between the nomination of candidates (at primaries) and the general election, during which candidates campaign, including answering questions from the voters.  (If they answer.)  Four months would obviously not be reasonable for an online election, but neither is four (or five) days.

:A two-question limit is perfectly reasonable, and was effective in the past; hypothetically, the questions are supposed to provide information for the voters, and there are so many of them that most voters will wind up just going on their gut rather than trying to make it through all that.

The problem isn't the amount of time taken spent answering questions (although the current arbs, the only ones who can know, seem to regard it as a poor measure) but with the amount of time it takes for voters to read the questions and answers - there is a strong feeling that TLDR applies. I have personally spent around 8 hours so far reading the questions asked of candidates and I have only got down as far as RegensPark. When I am finished I will then go back and look for new questions and answers from each candidate before casting my vote. Limiting the number of questions should also focus people's minds on asking only the most relevant, least duplicative ones - e.g. candidates are asked how they will handle being outed 2 or 3 times each which educates voters no more than if it was asked once, and the candidates views on judicial incarceration in the USA are of no relevance I have been able to determine.

== Signficant inconsistency concerning vacant seats ==

Two statements are inconsistent with each other, under "Vacant seats" overleaf: 

"The committee will continue to have 15 seats, leaving nine vacant seats filled in this election."

and 

"The minimum support percentage is 50%."

Can someone please explain? [[User:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">'''Tony'''</font >]] [[User talk:Tony1|<font color="darkgreen">(talk) </font >]] 13:43, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

:The sentence immediately after the second you quote explains it, "If there are more vacancies than candidates with 50% support, those seats will remain vacant." although the section is poorly phrased, changing as follows would imho resolve it:
:*"The committee will continue to have 15 seats, leaving nine vacant seats <s>filled in</s> ''for'' this election." 
:*"8 seats <s>will be filled for</s> ''have'' 2 year terms, and one <s>will be filled for</s> has a 1 year term."

::Yes, it's just poorly written.  There was some discussion of the wording (though not necessarily the specific issue Tony raises) prior to the nominating period, and I started trying to fix it up by changing a few words there and there but I kept finding more and more problems with that paragraph and eventually just gave up and didn't change anything, and never got back to it.  (I don't think there would be anything wrong with editing it now, as long as the meaning were not changed -- well, not changed from what it is ''supposed'' to mean.  I don't think that specific wording was "adopted" by an RfC, though I could be wrong about that.)  On the other hand, I do not see anything wrong with using the word "filled", as long as it is made clear that while there are nine seats to be filled, a seat would go unfilled if fewer that nine candidates achieve 50% percent support -- which is (I think) what Tony's point is.

::I just made a small edit to that paragraph (changing "seats filled" to "seats '''to be''' filled.)

The very next sentence after "The minimum support percentage is 50%." is "If there are more vacancies than candidates with 50% support, those seats will remain vacant."  (Later note, now I see Thryduulf already pointed that out.)  So I think that part is clear enough.  There are nine seats "to be filled", but the actual number of seats that '''will''' be filled will depend on how many candidates receive at least 50% support.  As I said before, however, the whole thing could use a rewrite.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 19:52, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
:::I can see there's going to be dramah if fewer than nine candidates make it over this ridiculous, arbitrary 50% formula mark (in practice, very candidates are ever supported by more than 50% of voters, which many editors would say is a more realistic measure). The graph just below this two-timing text marks eight seats with "Top 8 Candidates" and one with "9th Place". Sounds pretty cut-and-dried, don't you think?

::::Of course there would be "dramah."  This is Wikipedia.  There's drama over everything.  The WMF would save a lot of money if they could figure out a way to power the servers with drama instead of electricity.  But there would be much MORE drama if anyone were ever appointed to ArbCom with more opposes than supports.  I think the past RfC's show that a large majority would prefer to see empty seats on the committee rather than have arbitrators who received a majority of opposes.  As for "cut-and-dried":  Our election method here is kind of unusual, and kind of complicated, and therefore not the easiest thing to describe, especially when the description was written "by committee" over a period of years.  I think the system is ok, we just need a better description.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 04:50, 4 December 2013 (UTC)
:::::We do try to minimise the risk of drama, surely. The problem with the argument you put is that no one knows how many opposes were cast for any one candidate on the basis of "I really don't want that person to be an arb" versus the strategic voting rationale of "I don't know about that candidate, but I'm opposing everyone but my preferred few candidates, to give them maximum advantage in the formulaic race". (''I'' voted strategically, and I'm pretty sure it's a lot of others did too.) Reducing opposes to a simple binary message is a grand presumption, and I believe the corollary to that is that "better empty seats than arbs who received more opposes than supports" is based on a wobbly presumption about the meaning of opposes.<p>To put my neutral hat on: the graph text is a liability if you really want to exclude someone who received a formula-derived 49.9 ranking when only five got over the contrived 50 benchmark.

In 2010, a record 13 candidates received more tha 50% of support. 2010 was an unusual year because 12 seats were filled, and even that year, no seat was left vacant.

:::Tony1, when people say "more than 50% support", they mean "more supports than opposes", i.e. more than 50% of (supports + opposes).

:::(ec) Tony, we have this same discussion every year.  Hahc's figures are correct, because "abstains" don't count.  The instructions say:  "There will be an abstain option; choosing this option will not affect the support percentage for the candidate, and will be treated as though you did not vote in the election with respect to that candidate."  I don't think it could be made any clearer than that.  Abstains don't count for anything.  If 1000 people vote and a candidate gets 450 supports, 300 opposes and 250 people abstain, the candidate got 60 percent support.  That's the way our "system" counts it.  If you want to count it as 45 percent, you can, but that's not the system we have.  (Later added note:  Floquenbeam, thank you for correcting my math; I guess I was subconsciously illustrating that abstains don't count, by counting them incorrectly.)

::::Exactly. [[User:Tony1|Tony1]], as much as I understand the spirit of your comment, it is pretty off from what is the reality. By making a comparison with the number of voters, you count the ''abstain'' votes, which is a mistake. They do not count for the percentage of support, since they are not taking any sides. And well, for me, "13 received more supports than opposes" is ''exactly the same'' as "13 users got more than 50% of support".

:::::That's a problem if you don't see the difference. If someone goes into the system and doesn't vote support for candidate X, they're still a voter, right? It doesn't matter whether this voter voted oppose or neutral, they still didn't support candidate X, right? I'm simply counting the proportion of voters who supported candidate X, which is an almost universally understood measure. I suspect that this S/S+O weirdness was adopted by those whose interests are served by distorting massively upwards the real support that arbs garner at elections. It's time we punctured this fallacy, even if the official system counts this ranking formula. You're equating 50% ranking formula with 50% of the electors voted for X. Not so. And 12 supports, 8 opposes, and 874 neutrals whatever they're called, gives a formula ranking of 60. Great.

You should not count the thousands or millions who did not S or O the candidate.  You may have preferred a separate ballot for every candidate, with the options S or not(S), and ignore the non-voters, or do you support mandatory recording of preference for all candidates, or none?   I think a single ballot easier for the voters, and with all votes defaulting to A, every A should be interpreted no different to the voter not voting.

::::::(ec) Tony, I suspect that if something like that ever actually happened - someone being elected 12-8-874 or any similar pattern of numbers where the supports and opposes were completely dwarfed by the abstentions - there would be an uproar and the system would probably be changed.  But it hasn't happened, so it hasn't happened. My perception of how things work on Wikipedia is that policies and procedures are generally '''not''' changed simply because there is a concern that something bad might possibly, conceivably, hypothetically occur.  Generally the "something bad" has to actually happen, and even then there might not be consensus for a change.  Is that a good way to run an organization?  Probably not, but that's how Wikipedia seems to operate, and for better or for worse, it's still here.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 00:26, 5 December 2013 (UTC)
:::::::Tony, whether you agree with the way the 50% support is calculated or not is frankly irrelevant at this  point. The formula is explicitly and unambiguously defined and seemingly understood by almost everyone. The result=S/(S+O) method was chosen by consensus at an RfC a few years ago and reselected by an RfC in every year since. If you would prefer a different formula be used then you need to propose an alternative in next year's RfC (put a note on the feedback page as an aide mémoire if you want), and if your proposal gains consensus then it will be used for the 2014 election.

I believe this is fair and correct, but it seems this view is not universal.
*:As for expressing support as a percentage, I don't know why, but given the criteria used for this election the statements "At least 50% support" and "More supports than opposes" have identical meaning, and ranking candidates by the percentage support and ranking candidates by how many more supports than opposes they got produces an identical ranking I don't understand why it is an issue.

This is all legitimate, but entirely academic, discussion; and it's not particularly constructive to have it midway through the election.  The formula of S/(S+O) was formalised [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Arbitration Committee Elections December 2011#What should the minimum support percentage be in order to be considered for appointment to ArbCom.3F|in 2011]], and the selection of 50% (which is equivalent to requiring more supports than opposes) was first formalised there and then confirmed in 2012 and 2013.  This election will be conducted under that process.  Whether or not you think it is fair, democratic or sensible, now is not the time to change it.

I suppose the issue could be raised in the RfC for next year's election, but if we are to have a clear-cut "rule" on this, I would favor retaining what has been followed for this election:  If you are allowed to edit the project "at all", and otherwise meet the numerical criteria for candidacy, you are allowed to run.  Of course, a topic ban is one of the many facts that the voters may take into account when making their choices, and in this particular case, many of the "voter guides" mentioned the topic ban, so the voters were adequately informed of the topic ban.

**Putting on my SecurePoll administrator hat, why are you trying to tally the poll already?

Only when ALL of you have signed off that there are no further corrections or changes to the the vote data should you be tallying the poll.

**I'm going to be more specific here.  Go to [[Special:SecurePoll/list/360]]. Using the tabs at the top, look for same/similar IP and user agent combos (there are bound to be some) and then review the users to see if they are likely socks or are two people who reside together (there will be some of them, too).  Look for CSRF tags and see if there is a reason to question those votes; in the past, scrutineers have sometimes contacted those editors directly.  Look for near-identical usernames.  Check with the election commissioners to see if they have received any emailed concerns about possible socks.  Once you've investigated all of these issues, and all of you have signed off that you are satisfied there are no further votes to be eliminated, then you contact the person who holds the key (the election commissioners will tell you who it is and how to make contact). At that point, you can insert the key and do the tally.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 15:50, 10 December 2013 (UTC)

****SB_Johnny, every vote is recorded with the IP and user agent data; the scrutineers see the username, date of vote, IP, user agent, and if applicable a flag for possible duplicate or CSRF problem; nobody sees how any specific user voted. That information is available only to the scrutineers, which is why they must be WMF-identified, and should normally have some experience with Checkuser.

*******Well, the SecurePoll software doesn't permit any modification of the voter list or results once the tally is run; the entire poll is locked once the key is inserted and no changes to the voter list can be done, nor can any additional ballots be cast. That serves several purposes, first of which is to prevent vote manipulation, second of which is to prevent the scrutineers or election admins from peeking at the running tally and potentially providing that information to third parties, who may attempt to canvass or otherwise try to affect the outcome. They're secret ballots, and variance between the "raw" data and the "final" data could very well reveal the actions of the (few) votes that get struck.

*********** Yes, Flo, we're saying/asking the same thing.  I understood that CU was being granted to the stewards appointed by the arbs to oversee the election.  That it would also be granted to three editors chosen here in a very "relaxed manner" is something I find disconcerting. We should have clarity on this, and if those three members have access to IPs, then the process by which they are selected should be more broadly advertised next year.

**************You and Floquenbeam both raise good points. As I recall, for the first Arbcom election using SecurePoll, and the one go-round of CU/OS/AUSC elections using SecurePoll, all of the election admins were either already CU/OS (for Arbcom elections) or arbitrators (CU/OS/AUSC votes). I'm not entirely sure why it was decided a few years back that the steward scrutineers needed CU access — best guess I have is that they would do "regular" CUs to root out socking on voting if it was reported to them — but I've been a SecurePoll admin on two global elections and had no need for CU on either one, nor would I think it would have been helpful.

*************It says so right in the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2013/Coordination/Instructions_for_scrutineers|instructions for scrutineers]] that the election commissioners have the same access as the scrutineers. The giveaway is that, in reading the last sentence of the "Technical background" section, it's clear that election administrators (commissioners) have the ability to strike votes, but are not supposed to do so; only those with access to the IP/UA data are also able to strike/unstrike votes.

To be clear, although Risker has already done an excellent job of explaining, she is entirely correct.  There is only one class of SecurePoll administrator, and so both EC and scrutineers are given that level of access.  I posted [[:File:Wikipedia Securepoll details view.png|a screenshot]] of the interface last year which made it very clear what was and was not visible, to me as well as to the other SecurePoll admins.

For each vote cast, the IP, XFF and UserAgent information is recorded and is easily visible to all SecurePoll admins; so it is true that TParis, GiantSnowman and myself have access to that "CheckUser-like data" immediately related to the vote, in addition to the scrutineers.  It is ''not'' correct that we have CheckUser access in any more general sense.  We cannot use the normal CheckUser interface to investigate other wiki activity, either technically or by policy.

There seemed to be a problem tallying the results of the election.  Then Risker seemed to be saying that shouldn't be a problem because before the votes are tallied, some other things are supposed to happen, and at that point the whole thing turned into a blur for me due to my extremely vague understanding of technical stuff.  Then the whole section got off on a tangent, and I guess I'm sort of trying to pull it back to where it started.  Is everything ok?  Is everything that is supposed to be happening, happening, in the correct order?  I want to make it clear I am not trying to rush the results, because I remember that one year (the first year SecurePoll was used for an ArbCom election, I think) when people were rushing the vote-counters and scrutineers and there ended up being a problem that could not be fixed, but which luckily did not affect the outcome of the election.  We all want everything to be done properly and accurately even if it takes a little extra time.  So, there's not a really serious problem, is there?

::@[[User:Risker|Risker]]: I use to calibrate the depth of my analysis upon delta. A very very deep analysis must be taken with a 2 votes margin, while it's a useless waste of energies with a 50 votes margin. --[[User:Vituzzu|Vituzzu]] ([[User talk:Vituzzu|talk]]) 23:38, 11 December 2013 (UTC)
:::Well, that's kinda my point, {{ul|Vituzzu}}. It's not about the delta, it's about the acceptable votes. The only tally that matters is the one based on acceptable votes; there is no "delta" involved.  It's not that much work, with under 1000 votes the check reviews should take about 2 hours unless there are significant problems.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 00:12, 12 December 2013 (UTC)
:Sorry {{ul|Neutron}}, I didn't respond to your question.  Tallying wasn't "broken" because the decryption key has not yet been activated. It cannot be activated until all of the improper votes are struck, and the scrutineers so certify.  That is because once the tally is run, no changes to the voter list can be made; that is, votes of users who do not meet the criteria could not be struck.  This is a deliberate and intentional security measure to prevent the SecurePoll administrators from repeatedly running tallies, striking votes and running new tallies (thus negating the secrecy of the ballots). There is no actual problem here, and there is nothing that needs to be fixed.  The problem you refer to in your post is actually solved by the fact that repeated tallies cannot be run; the problem that first time was that scrutineers apparently were able to repeatedly run tallies and strike votes afterward, and my suspicion is that the first SecurePoll Arbcom election may not have been properly encrypted, although I agree that it did not make a difference in the outcome.  [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 05:07, 12 December 2013 (UTC)
::This (it not being permissible to publish more than one tally) is exactly what happened [[Wikipedia:ACE2009#Clarification_of_a_discrepancy_in_the_results|in 2009]] as Neutron says, when we discovered three duplicate votes just after the results had been published, and could not strike them without compromising their secrecy.  The ACE09 election was indeed not encrypted (nor were '10, '11 and '12), because managing the encryption requires more involvement from the WMF, which has not been as forthcoming in previous years.  Implementing encryption was the reason why the poll was restarted this year. 
::I do sympathise with Vituzzu's point about more rigour being required if the election is very tight; but it's also true that exposing the ranking before completing the striking is not really on.  It would be a good feature for SecurePoll to have an option to produce a tally of results, but ''without'' the candidate names, perhaps?

As an (informal) update, there have been expressions from three of the scrutineers that they are happy with the results, so we are near the end of the process (there may have been a final confirmation that I haven't been made privy to).  Even assuming that that is forthcoming, however, the new encryption means that the keys (which are currently locked in [[User:Philippe (WMF)|Philippe]]'s desk, apparently) need to be uploaded by WMF staff before the election can be tallied; that of course won't happen until Monday at the earliest.

== Percentages ==

I notice that this year the Net and Percentage columns have been left blank for losing candidates, a departure from years past. Is there a reason for this? It seems very useful for the community to know how close some of the losing candidates came to winning, and vice versa. Also, of course, like this we just have to take the scrutineers' word for it that that's who actually won, or, even worse, do math for ourselves. ;)

Congratulations and best wishes to all the winners.

I changed the "No vote" column heading (and the associated descriptive text) to "Abstain", to reflect the way this year's options were presented to the voters.  —&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich</u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''</small> 03:04, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

Actually "not voting" would appear to be the least confusing term here ... and should not require a third column, if a person votes neither "yes" nor "no" then the software should be able to figure out that the person did not vote on that issue.

== Description of ranking in results ==

[[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2013#Results]] says "The tally ranks candidates by level of support, defined as the number of votes cast in support of the candidate divided by the total number of votes cast for the candidate ("Abstain" preferences are not counted)." "Level of support" is vague, but it is then defined clearly; but then nowhere in this prose is it mapped to column in the table called "Percentage". And the denominator of that calculation is poorly explained as well: "votes cast <u>for</u> the candidate" (my emphasis) means "support" in lay language (synonymous with the numerator), not "support and oppose". Clearer wording might be "level of support among those who expressed an opinion about the candidate (the percentage of 'for' votes out of the 'for' and 'against' total)".

:Well yes, I'd picked this up immediately, but held back because I've already made a pig of myself in a thread above on this issue. I also don't think the values in that column should be appended with a % sign. Percentage of ''what''? I suppose it's S as a percentage of S+O, which disregards the <u>real</u> level of support for each candidate among the voters—this is a much lower figure, but is a true representation if someone is thinking of ascribing "mandate". Only one candidate—28bytes—gained the support of more than half of the voters. That doesn't bother me, but let's not fool ourselves by ascribing bloated "levels of support" from that formula, expressed as a simple percentage. Again, people voted neutral and oppose for various reasons, some of them purely strategic to advantage the supports they'd chosen (a rational method, IMO).

:::Pretty abstract for most punters to understand; it's just a mathematical construct.

:Any change or replacement of the existing ArbCom election method is going to have to make it reasonably clear that the chosen winners have community support.  I believe this means voters must be given the option of explicitly opposing candidates; otherwise, there will be no real way of determining how many (if any at all) of the candidates really do have the backing of the community (as opposed to merely getting the most votes).

:I do think, though, that the current S/(S+O) ranking has serious problems.  {{u|Tony1}} makes a reasonable point when he questions how meaningful these "support percentages" really are.  And we run a risk here of electing someone who has very little support '''but also''' virtually no opposition (i.e., a very low S, but an even smaller O).

:I would propose a new system where people could vote just as they do now, but instead of ranking candidates per S/(S+O), the winners would be the candidates with the most "support" votes — '''and with the additional rule''' that anyone with more "oppose" than "support" votes (i.e., a negative "net" score) would be eliminated and skipped over.  This would make the system much simpler — easy to understand and (presumably) to accept — while still allowing voters to register meaningful opposition to candidates they might consider to be really bad news.

:This modified system would not require any changes to SecurePoll; the only difference would be in the way the winners are selected.  To see what I mean, take the existing results and re-sort the candidates in descending order by "support" votes.  The hypothetical results in my proposed modification would be almost the same as the official results — except that Guerillero would have been elected instead of LFaraone, and the one-year seat would have gone to Guerillero instead of Beeblebrox.  (I would still not have won a seat under this modified scheme. {{smiley}})  Again, anyone with a negative "net" score would be eliminated from consideration regardless of their level of support; if more seats needed filling in this hypothetical scenario, the next winners in order would be LFaraone, RegentsPark, Ks0stm (skipping David Gerard and me because of our negative "net" scores), and Gamaliel.

::I am not sure what problem that would be solving.  I went back and looked at how the four previous elections would have been affected by your scenario.  As with this year, it would result at most one (and in one year, zero) arbitrators being elected who were not elected under the current system.  In NONE of the years (including this year) would anyone have been "skipped" over due to getting more opposes than supports.  Leaving aside order-switching and switching between one and two-year terms, here is what difference it would have made:  In 2009, AGK gets elected instead of KnightLago.  (Though interestingly enough, if there had been one more seat, FredBauder and Cla68 would have been skipped over with less than 50%, with Wehwalt getting the last seat.)  In 2010, Sandstein gets elected instead of Jclemens.  In 2011, there is no difference (except for a swap of one-year vs. two-year between Jclemens and SilkTork.)  In 2012, Elen of the Roads gets elected instead of David Fuchs.  What does all this mean?  Maybe it means your scenario gives a ''slight'' advantage to someone who is "controversial", but not ''so'' controversial that their support percentage falls below 50%. Some people might see that as a good thing, others not.  But the main point is that it would not really make a very big difference.

:(ec) Unless I am mistaken, "approval voting" (with secret balloting) was used in the first two ArbCom elections, in 2004.  (I was not around then, but I have read about it.)  After a series of discussions in 2005, this system was replaced by the support/oppose system with open voting for the January 2006 election.  (The secret ballot was adopted for the December 2009 election, but still with support/oppose voting.)  Before we go too far down the road of "approval voting" (or the more real-world-like system where you vote for a number of candidates equal to or less than the number of available seats, and those with the most votes win), we ought to explore why that system was abandoned.  I think it probably had something to do (as I think Risker is suggesting) with people wanting successful candidates to have "community support", independent of how a candidate stacks up against the other candidates.  I am a little surprised that the idea of approval voting is coming back up; in the past few RfC's (though not this year's) the most popular alternative to the current system was some form of "preference voting", though it didn't go very far, partly because its proponents never really identified a specific system.  As I have said in the past, I would not mind seeing an experiment with [[Single transferable vote]], but I doubt it would get a consensus once people understood that it is '''''designed''''' to elect some candidates who would not get majority support under the current system (meaning, they would get more "opposes" than "supports".)

::Your proposal is certainly much better than actually ''using'' the formula as the sole determinant, and I'd support it if there were no other likely prospect of change. But the question remains as to why voters tick ''oppose''—for multiple reasons, not all to do with their opposition per se to a candidature. By now we're all familiar with "strategic oppose voting" as an approach to maximise the power of one's supports. Why are you so set on building in this negativism, even the barrier of 50? Support is support, I say. If you don't support a candidate, just don't tick support. Binary, not ternary. If more voters oppose than support a candidate, who's to say that many of those voters weren't just advantaging their favoured few (as I and—anecdotally—many others did)? Neutron, you hypothesise that back in the rather crude days of 2005, the simple, widely used system was dispensed with because (some) people argued that "successful candidates [should have] have "community support", independent of how a candidate stacks up against the other candidates [in support votes]". So we got a system where community "support" is defined by how a candidate stacks up against the other candidates in terms of support ''and'' oppose votes. It's just another, more complex and flawed way of defining "community support", oddly embracing "support" in negative terms. And let's not forget that one fatal flaw is that the voting ''intensity'' is brought into play for each candidate: if a candidate is widely disregarded with neutrals, in particular, 20 supports, 15 opposes, and 888 neutrals gives them a formula ranking of 57.1%. What kind of community support is ''that''? It's an extreme example, but potentially plays out at higher numbers, too. So concerned about this scenario were those who ran the WMF Board of Trustees (including Risker) that they introduced a special "floor" to prevent it.

::I agree with Neutron that if we are to change voting systems (which I'm not sure is necessary) [[Single transferable vote|STV]] is the best option. The major problem I see with it, however, is its complexity. In the first place, I'm not sure whether SecurePoll is equipped to provide a ballot that allows ranking all the candidates in order. And even if it is, it will quite likely be unable to perform the calculations required to determine the quota and distribute surplus and excluded preferences. Plus there isn't just one version of STV. We would have to decide whether to use the [[Hare quota]], the [[Droop quota]], the [[Imperiali quota]] or the reinforced Imperiali quota. We'd also have to choose between the random subset, Hare, Cincinnati, Wright, Hare-Clark and Gregory methods for distributing surplus votes, plus the Meek, Warren and Wright methods for dealing with secondary preferences for prior winners. Not to mention whether to use bulk exclusions and whether the single transaction, segmented transaction or iterative count approaches to distribution of excluded candidates' preferences should be used. In short, STV is a good system, but really complicated. [[User:Neljack|Neljack]] ([[User talk:Neljack|talk]]) 06:31, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

:::To quote Einstein, I think the ArbCom election system should be "as simple as possible, but no simpler".  Choosing the N candidates who get the most votes is really simple, and I think we should aim for this approach except to the extent (if any) that there are compelling reasons not to.

:::At the same time, there do appear to be good reasons why we need some indication that arbs have a tangible measure of community support (as opposed to just being the N candidates who got the most votes).  For example, when the WMF was asked whether non-admin arbs (if any were elected) would be granted access to private data, they agreed to do this '''because''' they accepted victory in an ArbCom election as indicating a degree of community support comparable to passing at RfA — and it's reasonable to speculate (though I do admit it is only speculation) that a major factor in this decision was the existence of both "support" and "oppose" options in the ArbCom voting process.  Additionally, I understand Jimbo has said he will not appoint arbs who don't get a net "support" in an election — another reason why we probably do need to continue offering voters the opportunity to explicitly oppose as well as support candidates.

:::I understand, as well, that some people have expressed concern about the possibility of ArbCom getting filled with unqualified, harmful candidates if the election process were solely a matter of who could get the most support.  I'm not fully convinced that the existence of an "oppose" option really addresses this concern — a mob of voters supporting a "bad" candidate could, after all, vote to oppose all the "good" candidates just as easily as supporters of "good" candidates could vote to oppose "bad" candidates — but it is an issue that probably does need to be addressed somehow, hopefully in conjunction with an analysis of the various reasons why people do vote to oppose candidates as opposed to simply abstaining.

:::In my opinion, single-transferrable-vote (or any other complex preferential voting system) would unduly complicate the ArbCom election process to no good end.  —&nbsp;[[User:Richwales|<u>Rich</u>]][[User talk:Richwales|wales]] <small>''(no&nbsp;relation to Jimbo)''</small> 19:21, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
::::I think STV would probably produce a "better" ArbCom - or at least, one more representative of the community - but I agree that the benefits probably would be outweighed by the complexity of the system.  That includes all the wrangling that would have to go into deciding the "detail issues" mentioned by Neljack, only a fraction of which I understand.  And that would be another problem with it - because only a very small number of people really understand all that stuff, the decisions that would affect who gets elected would be made by the same tiny fraction of the community.  And then when the election was over, very few people would understand why Candidate A was elected instead of Candidate B.  So it's not going anywhere - but I don't agree that it would be "to no good end."  It would be good, just not good enough to counterbalance the disadvantages.

== Does electing half of ArbCom at each election cause too much disruption? ==

Firstly, congratulations to the winners of the election. Secondly, this election made me wonder whether we're currently going about things the right way. Is it right that we currently put half of ArbCom up for election every year? For understandable reasons, the rate of arbitrators running for re-election is low, which means at every election, we get a bunch of new ones and almost half of ArbCom is made up of new arbitrators. I have little experience of ArbCom myself, but it strikes me that that must be pretty disruptive to its running every year, with so many new arbs having to learn the ropes at once.

I understand the previous system elected one third of ArbCom every three years, but this was changed because three-year terms were felt to be too long. What about if we instead kept the terms at two years, but elected one-quarter of arbitrators every six months? That would mean holding elections twice as often, but only one-quarter of ArbCom would change at each one, creating greater continuity in the committee. Or would more frequent elections be ''more'' disruptive overall?

I'd be particularly interested to hear from current and former arbitrators, and others who have experience dealing with ArbCom, on whether more frequent elections would be a good or bad idea. [[User:Robofish|Robofish]] ([[User talk:Robofish|talk]]) 01:25, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
:Having recently looked through the history of ArbCom elections, the turnouts and the history of the candidates who were elected, I already feel like the pool of potential arbitrators is already diluted (no offense to those recently elected). Having more frequent elections is only going to result in us electing someone unfit to be an arbitrator and more members of ArbCom to be ousted because of outcomes to tough cases.

*I never thought I would say this, but I think the 3-year terms actually worked better. We still (re)elected about half the committee each time, but there was a little bit more depth in the ability to carry out knowledge transfer. I'm currently in the process of "on-boarding" new arbitrators, and it's a lot more work than meets the eye: I have a spreadsheet to track who needs access to what and it has 20 columns (including notes, confirmation of email, confirmation that ID was submitted).

:: Elections are stressful. I don't think elections every six months is a solution.

Looking over the elected new arbitrators, I know almost all of their names which means that they already have quite a presence on Wikipedia. There are not newbies getting elected here, most of these folks have been on WP for years.

Responding to the original post, the Arbitration Committee elections each year take up an enormous amount of the community's time and effort. I don't think it's justifiable to further increase that commitment of our contributors' time and effort which is, at all times, our most important resource.

== 7% female arbitrators ==

In the future, I would like to see the number of women arbitrators meet or exceed the number of female editors, including by pre-allocation of female-only seats. [[User:EllenCT|EllenCT]] ([[User talk:EllenCT|talk]]) 05:33, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
:Well, it's pretty much at that level right now. You need to keep in mind that 50% of the women candidates for this role were elected, which is a much better percentage than can be said of just about any other "identifiable" group of candidates. If there are few women candidates, it's unlikely this proportion will change; it has been years since there were more than two women on the committee at any time, and last year I was the only one. This year, GorillaWarfare is it.  Speaking as a woman who is just finishing 5 years on the committee and knows the nature and volume of work involved, I can say honestly that I see absolutely no value in "pre-allocation" of seats to individuals who can't otherwise get themselves elected. If they've got the skill set and they're willing to stand, women candidates generally do quite well, and are actually considerably more likely to be elected than male candidates. [[User:Risker|Risker]] ([[User talk:Risker|talk]]) 05:54, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
::Indeed, if we want more female arbitrators we need more female candidates, so the first question that needs answering here is "why are more female editors not standing for election?". Until we can answer that question, we wont know what needs to be done to increase their representation on the committee. As a starting point for that, I'd encourage any woman reading this to answer the following questions:
::#Why did you not stand for the Arbitration Committee this year?
::#What change(s) to the committee or the arbitration system would make you stand?
::I don't expect that this will give anywhere near a representative sample or provide the answers. Certainly nothing suggested as an answer to 2 should blindly applied.

:::Well, speaking as a female editor who a couple people urged to run this year: 1) I didn't run because I am already harassed quite enough (about my gender, my sexuality, and my topics of interest, as well as a number of other things that have little to do with being female) due to my Wikimedia participation, and painting a bigger target on my back is not something I'm inclined to do. 2) Any system in which arbitrators are "fair game" for abuse and harassment, either on-wiki or off, is going to put off female editors who think like I do (which, mind you, is not all of them). I don't have any ideas for how to cut down on the amount of abuse arbitrators take beyond "maybe start enforcing some level of civility?", but until something happens to limit the abuse/harassment, only a very, very particular personality, in a very, very particular life situation is going to be prepared to step into that role. My sense is that fewer women than men have that particular mindset and are in that particular life situation.

::So given that we're not aiming to be a democracy, we might perceive that women (or some other group, though probably not the ones you mention) are typically better (than men) at dispute resolution, but typically more reluctant to stand in elections, and thus the project would benefit from some sort of action which encourages them to stand.

:::The ideal arbitration committee would represent the broad range of backgrounds of the community it serves.

Ethnicity is a harder one, as what constitutes a minority is geographically dependent, as a white British person living in London I'm part of the ethnic majority, but if I were to move to India say I'd instantly become part of a minority. I don't support affirmative action to get anyone onto the committee, but when there is no limit to the number of candidates, encouraging under-represented groups to stand is imho a Good Thing.

{{od}}I don't view the proposal as "nonsense". I once worked for a private consulting firm who elected its own board. We had several "inside limits" which over-rode the preferences that would otherwise arise from the voting. My recollection is that we required one board member to be younger than 40 years of age, and we had some geographical minimums by continent, to make sure we had geographical representation. I do not automatically rule out consideration of similar limits, although I can see potential for abuse. One mathematical note, I would urge that the limit be set below the proportionate representation, or problems can ensue. For example, if we decided, as a community, that there was value in having female representation, I would support a minimum that was below 7%, but not one that was effectively 7%. As an example of something I would consider supporting, I think a non-admin might be a useful addition to the committee, so would consider an inside limit that elects at least one non-admin, should any be qualified to run (possibly also requiring some minimum support.)--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 19:40, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

As I understand it, one of the nine arbitrators elected this year (and one of the eight elected to a full two-year term) is female.  That's 11.11...% of the total elected this year and 12.5% of those elected to two-year terms.  As of one year ago, two of the 15 arbitrators were women, which was 13.33% of the total.  I also believe (though I can't prove) that if more women ran, more women would be elected.  (There were only two female candidates this year, I believe.)  So if 7% percent is your goal, the voters are capable of achieving that without any "allocation", and have done so.  Also, isn't it clear to everybody that the under-representation of females on ArbCom is just a symptom of the larger issue of females choosing to edit Wikipedia at a much lower rate than males?  Once that problem fixes itself, the rest should fall into place.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 23:04, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

*You're very kind, Seraphimblade. :-)  Realistically, though, there are many, many other things that affect the balance of the committee.  In 2014, with the exception of one lone European, all of the arbitrators will come from the US or the UK; no Australians, Canadians, Africans, Asians, etc. There aren't a lot of members of the committee whose primary focus has been content improvement/development; the few who were once primarily content editors have been away from it for a while. There is a surfeit of members with technical expertise (most of whose skills I had no knowledge of beforehand!). But designating seats for geography, for gender identity or sex, for age, or for onwiki expertise is a mugs game. The encyclopedia risks having to accept someone who's not really the right fit simply because of their preferred categorization, or not getting an outstanding candidate because s/he came in second or third in the preferred categorization.

That being said, I would like to see a few more qualified females maybe run at the election next year, assuming of course that there are more qualified females that are willing to take a the nonsense complaints and agravations that accompanies such a position.

::I am not a fan of the Arbcom and there needs to be reform here but this doesn't make sense even to me. First we have enough trouble getting people to do this, by making it even harder we are guaranteeing that any candidates would be those who have carefully managed their wikicareer. I personally don't want more bureaucrats than we already have on Arbcom. The second problem with this is that the language "eliminating any who are far from the median" is too vague. What does that mean? Too Americanized? Not enough? Must be Catholic? Fond of cats and kids? It doesn't tell us anything and we have enough problems with extremism in this project in regards to politics and religion especially. Why does it need to be an admin, there are plenty of non admins fit for the task of Arbitrator. In fact I would argue that the committee should be part administrator, part regular editor and at least a couple members from the Foundation. Maybe someone like Maggie from the community liaison section. The committee should be a representation of all parties and stakeholders. The next problem is the demographic argument. We don't need to be appointing by statistic. We need the most qualified people (not that we have those now mind you). We should not be appointing based on race, gender, religion, diet or some other equally "arbitrary" cultural subgrouping.

:::I actually agree with both of you. In collect's defense Arbcom and the Arbitration process needs a makeover (along with other areas of Wikipedia), but I also agree with Leaky that before we start coming up with solutions we need to identify what the problems are. Are some of the things mentioned above problems, yes I think we can agree that most are. Not enough women, sure I think we could agree with that but that is a problem throughout the project, not just here. Do we need a wider demographic? I think we will all agree that would be good too, but how do we get there. None of these are problems with the committee or the process though. There are a lot or those so what we need to do is identify the core requirement for the committee. Are we meeting that (not really in my opinion), are we straying to far from that mandate (I believe it is), is it fair (no not really), are the cases managed fairly and appropriately (no not really), does Arbcom followup to ensure the cases are being enforced fairly (no not at all), it takes to long, its heavily biased towards admins over reguler editors, etc. This doesn't even include that Admins have to be brought before arbcom to be desysopped which I think is a waste of time and unnecessarily burdeonsome. So as you can see there are quite a few areas where we need to improve the process. If we can get more women involved and expand the demographic (which I'm not even sure what the demographics are frankly) that's great but I don't think its a critical problem.

:::Exactly.  I would add that this kind of discussion is really one that would make more sense within a political party; what should be the attributes of the candidates we nominate?  In some places, this is done overtly; in some countries where elections are done by "party list", Party X might have a rule that Candidate #2 must be of a different gender than Candidate #1, at least one of the Top 5 must be 35 or under, and at least one must be 65 or older, no more than 6 of the Top 10 can be of the same gender, and so on and so forth.  But Wikipedia does not have a party system (whether there are factions that could be called "parties" is a different story, but the elections are not organized along those lines.)  In the electorate as a whole, however, I don't see where this discussion is going.  It doesn't really mean anything in the abstract, meaning, without candidates to match with the attributes.  And as Resolute suggests, in an actual election, the voters look at the attributes of the candidates, at least so far as those attributes are disclosed, and the aggregate of the voters' individual decisions decides who is elected.  [[User:Neutron|Neutron]] ([[User talk:Neutron|talk]]) 23:23, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

The problem (if there is one) seems to be that some people think there are too many admins on Arbcom. But as long as we are electing Arbcom, most voters can be expected to vote for Admins, because they have the experience and proven willingness to do the kind of job that Arbcom does. If one wanted change it might be to stop electing Arbcom, and instead elect a Parliament that appoints and fires Arbcom members as it sees fit, with members of the Parliament barred from serving on Arbcom. In that case one could elect non-admins to Parliament in droves. Arbcom would still be populated by Admins but these would be accountable to the Parliament on a daily basis, instead of not being accountable to anybody for two years.

::Thanks, [[User:Risker|Risker]], but I think you're over-dramatizing a bit. What I suggested (or half-suggested, since I haven't actually indicated I think it's a good idea, rather than one that won't make much difference but might keep a few people happy) is roughly the equivalent of democratically elected police authorities. Roughly speaking, Admins are our cops, and Arbcom are our top cops (it's not an exact parallel as Admins and Arbcoms can also be seen as our judges, etc, but it will do). And all the criticisms you make can and probably have been made of democratically elected police authorities, but in practice such authorities don't stop people choosing to become cops or top cops. Indeed it may make life easier for them by leaving them free to ignore criticism from large numbers of ill-informed nutters out there in the community, in favour of merely taking on board some of the criticisms of a much smaller number of Authority members, many of whom are actually well-informed and reasonable people. I suspect that mostly they make very little difference in practice (which is perhaps why there's no huge demand for them in most places, but not much heated opposition to them where they do exist), but in some places (such as Northern Ireland) they arguably help make the police somewhat more acceptable to some dissatisfied sections of the community. Clearly the discussion here suggests some people are not happy with the kind of Arbcom we have, and if that is a serious problem (I'm not at all sure that it is), then such an 'Authority' might offer a partial solution (though obviously there'd have to be plenty of further discussion about the details of who gets to elect the Authority, and precisely what powers it got to have, etc). But I suspect it wouldn't actually make much difference, and it's probably not going to happen, if only because there currently isn't anybody particularly interested in pushing the idea. But I thought I'd mention it, just in case somebody out there does think it's a good idea and wants to try to carry it forward.

:: No rush from me either {{U|Hahc21|ΛΧΣ}}, but I was wondering if you could also get a time/vote chart to see at what rate the votes were coming in and if maybe the election was run too short of a period of time.  Based on what I read of that above linked discussion, there are some that think that 900 votes in two weeks wasn't enough time for a majority to get a chance to vote, and if the rate of votes per hour supports that, perhaps it would be appropriate to offer the election for a longer period next year?

{{unindent}} [[File:ACE 2013 Table 3.png|thumb|right|ACE 2013 voter evaluation table #1]] Okay, so I got the first piece of data together. According to what I did gather by now, most people vote on the first and last day of the elections. 304 users (or 33%) casted ''their first vote'' (only the first timestamp is considered for my studies) on 26 November, whereas 118 (12.78%) did so on 9 December. This represents 422 out of 923 votes (or 45.72%), and it means that almost half of the votes were accomplished in two of the fourteen days available to vote (or 14.28% of the time available to vote). If we add 27 November, which is the third and only day left with more than 100 votes, we'd have 524 votes (or 56.7%). A lot of additional conclusions could be drawn from the graphic at the right.

== If there was a quota, should it match editors or readers? ==

:There should not be a quota. Period. Nobody at all has demonstrated that Arbcom is better or worse depending on any of the demographics that have been batted around. In fact, one could argue that rejection of good candidates because they don't fit into some specific demographic would make Arbcom worse.  Arbcom isn't intended to be representative of any group other than those that experienced editors consider capable of managing disputes in relation to Wikipedia.  It is not a governing body.

::::Actually -- a slightly false position.  The key to reasonable quota systems depends on looking at the ''universe of qualified people'' for the task -- and determining what the percentages are ''within'' that universe.  Then the number of positions must be sufficient to allow for multiple subgroups -- say a "jury universe" for Wikipedia editors of about 100 would allow for any subgroup chosen in accord with "quotas" to be attainable.  This means, moreover, that if (say) 20 out of the hundred individuals were to be used for a given case, that if one group were underrepresented in the group of 100, that they would then be proportionately more likely to serve in the group of 20.

== Discarded ballots ==

I'm not trying to start a controversy here, but I was looking at last year's turnout to see how it to this year's (in relation to the above thread on turnout).  Anyway, I noticed that 136 of the 1,039 total ballots cast were discarded (for lack of a better term) this year by the scrutineers, compared to 2012 when 34 of 858 total ballots cast were discarded.  The 2010 and 2011 election pages don't list a total number of ballots cast, but judging from their respective log pages that only handful of votes were discarded in those years.  I'm just curious as to why the number of discards increased so much.
